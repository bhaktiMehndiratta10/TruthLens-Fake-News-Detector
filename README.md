# Fake-News-Detector

Fake news spreads faster than ever, and I wanted to see if machine learning could help tackle this issue. So, I built TruthLens - A Fake News Detector Prototype, and the results were quite promising!

ðŸ”¹ Dataset: 25,116 news articles (a mix of real and fake)

ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing: Applied stemming and tokenization to clean and structure the text data.

ðŸ”¹ ML Models: Tested multiple models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM, but Logistics Regression outperformed all of them!

ðŸ”¹ Final Accuracy: Achieved an impressive 97.52% accuracy on the testing data
